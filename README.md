## Project Description

Blebox tempSensor can be used as thermostat by it self, but it has no possibility (yet) to check device state, and work in conditional.
So for that kind of tasks, there is a need to use server, since blebox devices comunicate using url api commands.
The goal is, to create an embedded server working on ESP32 (idf), that can be a control unit handling remote thermostat task.
This can also be template for other more complicated tasks using blebox devices.

## Project info
- Software: Eclipse (with ESP32 Dev plugins)

- Send request url 
- Get request response
- Phrase response json 
- Multithreading
- GateBox state read
